If you have another idea, feel free to open an issue for discussion!

## Getting Started

Clone this repository with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Daneski13/Junco.git
```

Make sure you have the latest version of [KiCad](https://kicad.org/download/) installed if you want to make changes to the PCB. If you just want to make changes to the case files you may use any software of your choice (a free option is preferred), just provide the raw files in your PR.

## Making Changes

Make your changes in a new branch unless you are fixing markdown files. If you are only changing markdown files, you may make your changes on the `main` branch.

Update the README / documentation the details of your changes as necessary.
