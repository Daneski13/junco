# Junco v1.1 Build notes
* Flipped all switches to orient LED's away from user.
* Unified the LED orientation for easier builds.
* Flipped combo rotary encoders and switches, but maintained the encoder offset so that a plate update would not be needed. This required moving those LEDs to a lower position that intersects the switch center post hole. 
@todo: Is this preferable to updating the case files?
