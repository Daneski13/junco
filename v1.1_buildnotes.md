# Junco v1.1 Build notes
* Flipped all switch footprints to orient LED's away from user.
* Unified the LED orientation for easier builds.
* Flipped all LEDs to face toward board, allowing for automated assembly.
* Reworked all LED footprints to set the center X/Y point to 0,0, for automated assembly.
* Reworked all footprint sides (front/back) to better support automated assembly.
* Reworked LED footprints to use multiple through holes instead of edge cuts. This reduces manufacturing costs.
* Added combo diode footprints for SMD/through-hole.
* Improved diode orientation legibility.
* Rerouted all Pico traces to reduce the likeliness of shorts.
* Added GND/VCC planes for easier power routing.
* Flipped combo rotary encoders and switches, but maintained the encoder offset so that a plate update would not be needed. This required moving those LEDs to a lower position that intersects the switch center post hole. 
* Added a level shifter bypass. This was used to test the viability of SK6812 acting as a de-facto level shifter. That did not work, and the sk6812's increased draw caused the board to overheat. The bypass was left in the design regardless.
* Added hardware level handedness. Left hand GP18 is pulled high, right hand GP18 is pulled low. (I haven't submitted a QMK PR for this yet). @todo?
* Updated schematics to reflect handedness pin addition.

Wish list:
* The led drill holes are a little bigger than they need to be, so the LEDs tilt a bit during hand soldering. Tightening up the LED hole tolerances would make assembly easier.
* "Sandwich case" support. Adding holes to the PCB to allow standoff posts to go through it, so a pcb key plate and bottom plate can be used.
