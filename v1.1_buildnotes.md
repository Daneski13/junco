# Junco v1.1 Build notes
* Flipped all switches to orient LED's away from user.
* Unified the LED orientation for easier builds.
* Flipped combo rotary encoders and switches, but maintained the encoder offset so that a plate update would not be needed. This required moving those LEDs to a lower position that intersects the switch center post hole. 

@todo: Dumped screen caps in the images folder from the JLC PCB Assembly ordering process.

JLC order 6-16-23
@todo: The Pico VCC Leds have narrower traces so that all the diodes have a uniform orientation.
Rotate that diode - it's probably better to have a thicker trace there then uniform orientation.

Wish list:
The led drill holes are a little bigger than they need to be, so the leds tilt a bit during hand soldering. Tightening up the LED hole tolerances would make assembly easier.
